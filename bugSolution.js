The solution addresses the problem by implementing a cancellation mechanism using a state variable (`isMounted`). Before performing the asynchronous operation, the component sets `isMounted` to `true`.  If the component unmounts, `isMounted` is set to `false`.  The asynchronous operation checks `isMounted` before updating the state.  If `isMounted` is `false`, the state update is skipped, preventing warnings and potential crashes.  This approach helps ensure that state updates only happen when the component is still mounted.
