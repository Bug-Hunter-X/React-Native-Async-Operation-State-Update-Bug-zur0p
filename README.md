This repository demonstrates a common yet subtle bug in React Native development involving asynchronous operations and state updates. The bug occurs when an asynchronous operation, such as fetching data from an API, completes after the component has unmounted. This often leads to warnings in the console and can potentially cause unexpected behavior or application crashes.  The `bug.js` file showcases the problematic code, while `bugSolution.js` provides a solution using techniques like cancellation tokens or cleanup functions to prevent this issue. This example is crucial for understanding the importance of proper asynchronous operation handling in React Native to build robust and stable applications. Refer to the detailed comments within the code files for a complete explanation.
